C64-Snake
=========

A snazzy Snake clone in pure C64 BASIC
--------------------------------------

The aim of this project is to write a maximally performing Snake clone in C64 BASIC.

---

The classic Commodore 64 is capable of impressive visual and audio effects, but programming it in its native BASIC was always challenging if you were aiming for performance due to the interpretive runtime of C64 BASIC and the limited processing capacity of the MOS6502 CPU running at only 1MHz.

By emplying a mix of speed optimisation techniques, hopefully this will result in a reasonably challenging to play version of Snake.
